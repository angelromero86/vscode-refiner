# refine-resolve skill

You are reading open comment threads from `.refiner/comments.json` and acting on
each one — making the code change the human requested, then **replying** in the
thread with what you did. The human wrote these comments in the **Refiner** VSCode
extension; your replies show up inline for them.

## Arguments

- `thread-id` (optional): process a single thread by id (full id or unique suffix,
  e.g. `/refine-resolve a3f9c1b8`). If omitted, process every actionable open thread.

## Critical rule — read this twice

**You NEVER set `status` to `"resolved"` and you NEVER delete a thread or comment.**

Resolving is the human's job: they click the ✓ (Resolve) button in the Refiner
extension once they've verified your change. Your job ends at: code change applied +
reply comment appended. If you set `status` to `"resolved"` or remove any thread or
comment, you've broken the workflow. Don't.

## Storage format

The file is one JSON object: `{ "version": 1, "threads": [ ... ] }`. Each thread:

```json
{
  "id": "t-a3f9c1b8",
  "file": "src/foo.ts",
  "range": { "start": 42, "end": 45 },
  "status": "open",
  "comments": [
    {
      "id": "c-1",
      "author": "angel",
      "role": "user",
      "body": "this loop is O(n²)",
      "createdAt": "2026-07-17T10:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

You add a reply by **appending** a comment to that thread's `comments` array:

```json
{
  "id": "c-91b2e4d0",
  "author": "Claude Code",
  "role": "assistant",
  "body": "Replaced the scan with a lookup against `byFile`.",
  "createdAt": "2026-07-18T15:10:00.000Z"
}
```

- `role` — always `"assistant"` for your replies. This is how both the extension and
  this skill tell your messages from the human's.
- `id` — unique. Use `c-` + 8 hex: `python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(4))"`.
- `createdAt` — ISO-8601 UTC (current time).
- Leave `status`, `range`, `file`, the human's comments, and any `anchor` field
  untouched. Append only.

## Formatting the `body`

The extension renders `body` as **Markdown**. Write your reply as well-formatted
prose, not a wall of text — the human reads it in a narrow bubble beside their code.

**`body` is a JSON string, so line breaks are `\n`.** A blank line between paragraphs
is `\n\n`. Getting this wrong is the most common mistake: it collapses your whole
reply into one run-on paragraph.

Use, where they genuinely help:

- **Paragraph breaks** (`\n\n`) — separate what you changed from why, and from any
  caveat. One idea per paragraph.
- **`` `code` ``** — every identifier, file path, flag, type, and literal value.
  Write `` `byFile` `` and `` `null` ``, never bare byFile or null.
- **Fenced code blocks** — when the change is subtle enough that the shape matters
  (a tricky condition, a new signature). Tag the language: ` ```ts `. Keep them to a
  few lines — the human sees the full diff in their editor, so don't paste it back.
- **Bullet lists** — when you touched several files or made several distinct changes
  under one thread.
- **Blockquotes** (`> `) — when quoting the human's own words back to confirm which
  part you're answering, or citing a rule you followed.
- **Bold** — sparingly, for the one phrase that matters most.

A well-formatted reply:

```json
{
  "body": "Replaced the linear scan in `resolveThread` with a lookup against the `byFile` index.\n\nThe old loop walked every thread on each keystroke; the index is built once in `load()`, so this is O(1) per lookup and the O(n²) you flagged is gone.\n\n[suggestion] `findComment` just below has the same pattern, but it's off the hot path — left it alone. Say the word and I'll do it too."
}
```

Don't over-format: a one-line reply to a `[nit]` needs no bullets and no code block.
Match the structure to the size of what you did.

## Prerequisites

1. Confirm you're inside a git repo: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.
2. Read `.refiner/comments.json` from the repo root. If it's missing or has zero
   threads, tell the user there's nothing to do and stop.

## Instructions

### Step 1 — Collect actionable threads

Parse the JSON. For each thread, decide whether to act:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| `status` ≠ `"open"` | **Skip** (already resolved) |
| Last comment has `role: "assistant"` | **Skip** — you already replied; awaiting the human. |
| Last comment is a `[question]` you'd need the human to answer | **Skip and note** in the final summary. |
| Last comment has `role: "user"` with an actionable request | **Process** |
| Body starts with `[nit]` | **Process** — minor but actionable |

A `thread-id` argument overrides the loop — process only that thread (after the check).

### Step 2 — For each actionable thread, plan and apply the change

1. **Read the thread's full conversation**, not just the latest comment — earlier
   messages may carry context.
2. **Open the file at the thread's anchor** (`file`, `range.start`, `range.end`; the
   lines are 1-based). Read enough surrounding code — often the whole file.
3. **Interpret the request**:
   - Direct suggestion ("use a map instead of a slice") → make the change.
   - Question phrased as a suggestion ("should we add X?", "can we rename this?") →
     treat as a request, make the change.
   - Explicit `[question]` from the human → answer in your reply, no code change.
   - Truly unclear → reply asking for clarification (Step 4). Don't silently skip.
4. **Apply the change** with Edit. Stay scoped to the thread's intent — don't
   refactor neighbors or fix unrelated issues. If you spot something else, mention it
   in the reply but don't touch it.
5. **Verify**: run whatever fits (build, type check, tests). If your change breaks
   something, fix it. If it fails for a pre-existing reason, note it and move on.

### Step 3 — Append a reply comment to the thread

Edit `.refiner/comments.json` to append an `{ "role": "assistant", ... }` comment to
the thread you acted on. Do it in place — preserve every other thread and every
existing comment. The reply `body` should:
- State **what changed** (file + the gist).
- State **why it addresses the thread** (one sentence).
- Mention any related-but-out-of-scope thing as a `[suggestion]` for the human.

Format it per **Formatting the `body`** above — real paragraph breaks (`\n\n`),
identifiers in backticks, code blocks only where the shape matters.

After writing, re-read the file and confirm it's still valid JSON (no trailing
commas, balanced quotes). Invalid JSON makes the extension stop loading.

### Step 4 — When you can't proceed

If a thread is genuinely unclear, append a reply asking for what you need — a
specific question ("did you mean X or Y?"), not a guess. Then move to the next
thread. Do not invent intent.

### Step 5 — Hand off

Summarize for the user:

> Processed N threads:
> - Applied changes: A
> - Asked for clarification: B
> - Skipped (already replied / awaiting you): C
>
> Nothing was resolved or deleted — that's your call. In VSCode, verify each change
> and click ✓ (Resolve) on the threads you're happy with.

## Do NOT

- Do **not** change `status` on any thread. Leave it `"open"`.
- Do **not** delete any thread or comment — yours or the human's.
- Do **not** edit the human's comments, the `range`, `file`, or `anchor` fields.
- Do **not** batch unrelated changes under one thread's reply.
- Do **not** skip verification. If your change doesn't build/pass, fix it first.
- Do **not** leave the JSON invalid. Re-read your write and confirm it parses.
